    <h1>DONATE MONEY TO SERVING PEOPLE</h1>
    <div class="first">
        <p >We can be leaders in our communities by collecting unspoiled, healthy food and d
            onating it to our neighbors in need. By donating food, we’re feeding people, not 
            landfills, supporting local communities, and saving all the resources that went i
            nto producing that food from going to waste.
        </p>
        <p >Large manufacturers, supermarket chains, wholesalers, farmers, food brokers, 
            and organized community food drives typically give food to food banks.
            Restaurants, caterers, corporate dining rooms, hotels, and other food 
            establishments promptly distribute perishable and prepared foods to hungry
            people in their communities. Many food banks and food rescue organizations 
            will pick up food donations free of charge, saving donors time and money.

    <h1>DONATE REMAINING FOODS FROM FUNCTIONS</h1>
    <div class="first">
        <p>Many non-perishable and unspoiled perishable foods can be donated to
            local food banks, soup kitchens, pantries, and shelters if the transaction 
            is managed properly. Check with your local food bank or food rescue operation 
            to find out what items they will accept.
        </p>
        <p>Food rescue organizations operate food rescue programming, which includes the 
            retrieval of excess food from donors and/or the delivery of donated food directly 
            to clients or to other organizations that redistribute food to clients.
            These organizations may also offer other programming, such as education/skills
            training and the repurposing of donated food into meals or other food products, etc.,
            and many of them apply software solutions, like apps, to coordinate the 
            redistribution of excess food by volunteers or other organizations.
